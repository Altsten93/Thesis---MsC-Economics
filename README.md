# Thesis-MsC-Economics
This repository contains code used for a master's thesis in economics. The thesis investigates whether changes in the Swedish demographic profile might have contributed to a rise in income inequality.

The code for this thesis contains four subsections. 
(1) The data gathering; referring to collection, cleaning, formatting, and finally transforming into an easily managed data frame. 
(2) Calculates the changing population demographics over period 2000-2019.
(3) The finalized dataset; in which the more detailed analysis takes place. Visualization (/w GGPLOT), modeling, and robustness test are conducted here.
(4) The simulation part; in this section, I essentially simulate all incomes for the entire Sweden (2000-->2019) to compare outcomes with given not-so-good data from SCB.
