# Thesis-MsC-Economics
Hello there! This repository contains code used for a master's thesis in economics. The thesis investigates whether changes in the Swedish demographic profile might have contributed to a rise in income inequality.

The code for this thesis contains three subsections. 
(1) The data gathering; referring to the collection, cleaning, formatting, and finally transforming into an easily managed data frame. 
(2) The finalized dataset; in which the more detailed analysis takes place. Visualization (/w GGPLOT), modeling, and robustness test are conducted here.
(3) The simulation part; in this section, I essentially simulate all incomes for the entire Sweden (2000-->2019) to compare outcomes with given not-so-good data from SCB.
