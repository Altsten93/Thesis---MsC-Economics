# Thesis-MsC-Economics

Hello there! The code for this thesis contains three subparts. 
(1) The data gathering; referring to the collection, cleaning, formatting and finally transforming into a easily managed data frame. 
(2) The finalized dataset; in which the more detailed analyzation takes place. Visualizsation (/w GGPLOT), modelling, and robustness test are conducted here.
(3) The simualtion part; in this section I essentially simulate all incomes for entire Sweden (2000-->2019) to compare outcomes with given not-so-good data from SCB.
